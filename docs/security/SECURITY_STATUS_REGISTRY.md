---

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative source for security vulnerability status across the ZeroPay/NoTap codebase. All other security documentation should reference this file for current status.

**Rule:** When in doubt about security status, check THIS FILE FIRST.

| V001 | Backend | SSRF (16 vulns) | ✅ FIXED | 9.1 | 2026-01-23 | Handler validation | Re-tested with 140 payloads, 0 vulnerabilities |
| V002 | Backend | Replay Attack (nonce) | ✅ FIXED | 8.1 | 2026-01-23 | Dynamic Redis client | Verified: replay returns 403 |

| V009 | Backend | ZK-SNARK Placeholder | 🔴 OPEN | - | - | - | All proofs mock data, marked experimental |
| V010 | Architecture | No Factor Recovery | 🔴 OPEN | - | - | - | Forgotten factors = re-enrollment required |
| V011 | Scalability | Unverified Performance | 🔴 OPEN | - | - | - | No load testing performed |
| V012 | Documentation | Stale Status Markers | ✅ FIXED | - | 2026-02-16 | Created this registry | Reconciled contradictory docs |
| V013 | Architecture | Direct Redis Access (no abstraction) | ✅ FIXED | - | 2026-02-16 | All routes now use cacheService | Fixed 7 locations in verificationRouter, enrollmentRouter |

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| ✅ FIXED | Verified by test or code review | Update CHANGELOG.md, close ticket |
| ⚠️ MONITORING | Fixed but awaiting re-test | Schedule re-test |
| 🔴 OPEN | Known, not yet fixed | Prioritize in sprint |
| 🟡 IN PROGRESS | Fix under development | Update regularly |
| ❌ WONT FIX | Accepted risk or not applicable | Document rationale |

## How to Update This File

### When Finding a NEW Vulnerability

1. Add new row to the Vulnerability Status Matrix
2. Set status to 🔴 OPEN
3. Add to task.md for tracking
4. Create security ticket

### When FIXING a Vulnerability

1. **CRITICAL:** Update this file FIRST (before merging code)
2. Change status from 🔴 OPEN to ✅ FIXED
3. Add "Last Tested" date
4. Add "Fixed By" with brief description
5. Add reference to commit/ticket
6. Update all referencing documents (see below)

### After Updating This File

Run this command to find all documents that reference the fixed vulnerability:
```bash
grep -r "V00[1-9]" documentation/
```

Then update each referencing document to point to this registry.

## Canonical References

| Document | What It Contains | When to Update |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| `SECURITY_STATUS_REGISTRY.md` | **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** | Immediately on any change |
| `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` | Historical audit findings | Add links to registry, don't duplicate status |
| `COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_STATUS.md` | Compliance test results | Update after re-tests |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release notes | Add entry when deploying fixes |
| `planning.md` | Roadmap status | Update when priority changes |
| `task.md` | Active tasks | Update when starting/completing work |

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

- ❌ Adding new "FIXED" sections without updating original "NOT FIXED" entries
- ❌ Leaving stale status markers ("NOT FIXED", "STILL VULNERABLE") when fixed
- ❌ Having contradictory status across documents (check this file first)
- ❌ Updating CHANGELOG.md without updating this registry
- ❌ Marking as "FIXED" without verification/test evidence

---

## Quick Commands

### Check for stale status markers
```bash
grep -rn "NOT FIXED\|STILL VULNERABLE\|BROKEN" documentation/05-security/
```

### Check all docs reference registry
```bash
grep -rn "SECURITY_STATUS_REGISTRY" documentation/
```

### Verify a specific vulnerability is fixed
```bash
grep "V00X" documentation/05-security/SECURITY_STATUS_REGISTRY.md
```
